This repository contains a Python implementation of a logistic regression model for loan classification. 
The model is designed to predict whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on input features.

The model is trained and tested using a dataset named lending_data.csv, which is located in the Resources folder. 
The dataset includes various features related to loans, including loan status.
